# Log_File_Analyzer_VS

This is a continuation of my previous Log_File_Analyzer project but in this part I included a hosted streamlit based user interface where you can upload your own log files and have them sorted through and visualized with personal customizations. Here is the link to the streamlit web app: https://logfileanalyzerv2-mqcbsbefureeprzmwf2yqc.streamlit.app/

I also simulated real time processing if this system was ever to grow and be used with a live website. I included a downloadable PowerBI dashboard to analyze the results more precisely and included anomaly detection using a machine learning model.
